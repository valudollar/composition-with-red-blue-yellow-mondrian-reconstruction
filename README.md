I reconstructed Piet Mondrian's Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow (1930) with CSS!
It has been scaled to 450x450px with respect to the painting's original dimensions of 45 x 45 cm.

Something interesting during this fun exercise was that when I first thought I had completed it, I seemed to be about one pixel off and after on checking back to the original painting, I found that there was this detail I had missed where Mondrian did not paint the black line in the bottom right corner to the edge of the canvas.

And of course I had to recreate it as well to pay homage to Mondrian and his work!
